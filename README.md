# Test Store Project - Automated GUI testing with Selenium WebDriver  
This project is part of my Selenium WebDriver learning.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- In order to execute the tests, you can create an execution configuration or just open the Maven tab, click on "Execute Maven Goal" and enter `mvn test`  
- In order to change the browser, go to the testng.xml file and change the value of the parameter "browser". If you want to change it for a specific test class, just open the class tag and add another parameter tag for the browser.
- A screenshot is taken if the test fails. The output folder is \target\screenshots.
